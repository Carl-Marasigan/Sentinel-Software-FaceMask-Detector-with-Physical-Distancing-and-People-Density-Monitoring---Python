 **SENTINEL MONITORING SOFTWARE: A FACEMASK DETECTOR WITH PEOPLE DENSITY AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING MONITORING SOFTWARE USING YOLOv4 ALGORITHM**
 
Computer Vision is a type of artificial intelligence that makes use of a computer's processing capabilities to extract pertinent information from given datasets, including images, videos, and other media. Depending on the use cases, computer vision can be expanded to a variety of additional applications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the umbrella term encompassing Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. This study on Face Mask Detection, People Density, and Physical Distancing employ Computer Vision and Deep Learning to comprehend various attributes of videos and images based on frames provided to the algorithms as input.

YOLOv4 prioritizes real-time object detection and training. The researchers select YOLOv4 since it obtained an accuracy performance of 43.5 percent speed (AP) at 65 frames per second (FPS) on the COCO dataset, also the algorithm is free and open source.

The Facemask Detection is tested to be working on a Windows PC with a CUDA-supported GPU. The People Density was tested to count both masked and unmasked people and people. The Physical Distance was tested to detect a person who complies with physical distancing.
